    <h4>Hen Natural Incubation</h4>
    <p>Once you have your eggs - you need to decide if you are
      going to incubate them underneath a chicken or using an artificial
      incubator. To incubate an egg naturally, you will need
       to have a hen which is prepared to sit on the eggs for a
       full three weeks. This is called a “broody” or “sitting” hen.
        The eggs in the nesting box is called a “clutch” or “setting”.
        If a hen was doing this without human intervention,
        it would generally go broody when it has built up around a dozen eggs.
        If you have a large number of eggs or are incubating the eggs to sell
        then it might be worth considering using an incubator.</p><img src="henwitheggs.jpg" alt="hen">
